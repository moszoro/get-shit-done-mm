## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Hybrid constitution model (global + project) allows base rules for all projects while supporting project-specific needs
- Error-level enforcement (not fatal) blocks verification but allows experienced users to override when necessary
- TDD-first as initial NON-NEGOTIABLE is highest-value enforcement, prevents most common executor violations
- v1 focuses on constitution + TDD only to reduce scope and ship faster

### Pending Todos

1. **Rewrite Phase 6 as repository contribution** — Copy Phase 6 changes from GSD install to repo files for PR (planning)

### Blockers/Concerns

None yet.
