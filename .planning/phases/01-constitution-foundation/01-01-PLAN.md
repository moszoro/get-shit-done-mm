<objective>
Create constitution file templates defining structure, severity levels, and initial TDD enforcement rule.

Purpose: Establish constitutional file format that will be loaded by constitution system. Templates define YAML frontmatter structure, severity sections, and rule format with examples.

Output: Two markdown templates ready to be instantiated during GSD installation and project initialization.

  <action>
Create global CONSTITUTION.md template at `get-shit-done/templates/constitution/global-constitution.md`.

Structure:
1. YAML frontmatter with version (1.0.0), lastUpdated placeholder
2. Introduction explaining constitution purpose
3. Three severity sections as H1 headers: `# NON-NEGOTIABLE`, `# ERROR`, `# WARNING`
4. Rules distributed by severity (see below)

NON-NEGOTIABLE rules (cannot be overridden, blocks verification):
- **TDD-01: Test before implementation** - Test file must exist and be committed before corresponding implementation file
- **SEC-01: No hardcoded secrets** - API keys, passwords, tokens must use environment variables or secure vaults, never hardcoded in code
- **SEC-02: Parameterized queries only** - Database queries must use parameterized statements to prevent SQL injection, never string concatenation

ERROR rules (blocks verification but can be overridden with justification):
- **SEC-03: Input validation required** - All user input must be validated (type, format, range, length) before processing
- **SEC-04: Output sanitization required** - All user-controlled data rendered in UI must be sanitized to prevent XSS attacks
- **SEC-05: Authentication/authorization checks** - Protected resources must verify user identity and permissions before access

WARNING rules (reported but doesn't block):
- **SEC-06: Secure dependency management** - Dependencies must be from trusted sources, regularly updated, vulnerability-scanned
- **SEC-07: No sensitive data exposure** - Error messages, logs, responses must not leak passwords, tokens, PII, internal paths

Each rule format:
- Rule heading: `### RULE-ID: Short description`
- Description: What the rule requires
- Rationale: Why this rule exists, what failures it prevents
- `## Good Example` with passing scenario
- `## Bad Example` with violation scenario
- Code blocks demonstrating compliance vs violation

Anti-pattern documentation (DOC-01, DOC-04):
- Each rule must have "Why this rule exists" explanation
- Include specific failure modes prevented by rule
- Reference executor context limits, verification constraints

GSD style integration (DOC-03):
- Imperative voice in rule descriptions
- Technical precision in examples
- No filler words or emojis

Follow CONTEXT.md decisions for format (YAML frontmatter, markdown body, severity hierarchy).

Contains SEC-01 and SEC-02 rules under NON-NEGOTIABLE section.
Contains SEC-03, SEC-04, SEC-05 rules under ERROR section.
Contains SEC-06, SEC-07 rules under WARNING section.
All rules have rationale and examples.

Template includes versioning, severity sections, TDD-01 rule, and 7 security rules (SEC-01 through SEC-07) with rationale and examples.
File follows YAML + markdown format from CONTEXT.md.

  <files>get-shit-done/templates/constitution/project-constitution.md</files>
  <action>
Create project CONSTITUTION.md template at `get-shit-done/templates/constitution/project-constitution.md`.

Structure:
1. YAML frontmatter with version (1.0.0), lastUpdated placeholder
2. Introduction explaining project constitutions extend/override global
3. Same three severity sections as global (NON-NEGOTIABLE, ERROR, WARNING)
4. Placeholder comments in each section showing override syntax
5. Example override rule (commented out) demonstrating rule ID format

Content:
- Frontmatter identical to global template (version, lastUpdated)
- Introduction: "Project constitution extends global CONSTITUTION.md. Rules defined here override global rules with matching IDs."
- Each severity section contains commented example: `<!-- ### PROJ-01: Project-specific rule -->`
- Override precedence explanation: "Project rules with same ID as global rules replace global definition"
- Empty sections by default (projects add rules as needed)

Keep minimal (30-40 lines) - project constitutions are opt-in extensions, not full duplicates.

Follow same format conventions as global template.
